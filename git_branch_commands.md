## Create a new branch: 
- And switch to it once created (ex: You are at the main branch and created foo_dev branch with this command. Git will switch from main to foo_dev). 

```
git checkout -b ADD_THE_NEW_BRANCH_NAME_HERE
```


- But stay in the main/parent branch (Here it will stay in the main branch).
```
git branch ADD_THE_NEW_BRANCH_NAME_HERE
```

To move to the new branch use: 
``` 
git checkout NEW_BRANCH_NAME
```


## Delete a new branch (Includes No Commits!): 
```
git branch -d ADD_THE_BRANCH_NAME_HERE
```
